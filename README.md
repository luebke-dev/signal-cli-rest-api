## Installation

### pip

If you install signal-cli-rest-api through pip you need to manually install [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli) on your system.

```console
# by default the app will look for the signal config files in ~/.local/share/signal-cli
# you can change the directory by setting the SIGNAL_CONFIG_PATH env var to the desired path
# e.g. export SIGNAL_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/signal
pip install signal-cli-rest-api
uvicorn signal_cli_rest_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Docker

```console
export SIGNAL_DATA_DIR=~/signal/
docker run --name signal --restart unless-stopped -p 8000:8000 -v $SIGNAL_DATA_DIR:/root/.local/share/signal-cli sebastiannoelluebke/signal-cli-rest-api
```

### docker-compose
